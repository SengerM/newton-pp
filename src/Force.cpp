/*
	Force object constructor.
	Params are:
		* string str: A string specifying the name of the force. For exmaple "elastic force 1" or "my magnetic field".
		* ForceFormula_t function: This is a function whose prototype is of the form specified by «ForceFormula_t» that defines the way the force is obtained in terms of the interacting particles and other parameters.
		* size_t param_numer: This number specifies the nuber of params the force function «function» is waiting for. For example if the force is an elastic force of the form «F=k/2*(x-l)^2 then it uses two params «k» and «l». This number is used internally when checking if the force object is ready to use.
		* bool is_f: If «true» then the force object is configured as being a force due to a field, that means that the force acts over ONE particle. If «false» then the object is configured as being a force between TWO particles.
